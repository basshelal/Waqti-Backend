# TODO

* Everything should be a Property initially with the option to switch to a Constraint and back

* Make sure all Task Properties are working perfectly

* Check the infinite looping stuff with other Task Constraints like before and after, we can use Task IDs for this

* Consider removing the inheritance between Constraint and Property

* Make sure before and after Constraints work well with Tuples perfectly

* Make sure Properties can become Constraints and still work

* Make sure killing and failing and the Task Lifecycle works perfectly

* Organize tests properly
