#List

A List is an abstract Collection of Tasks that groups Tasks sequentially and orders them by a given attribute or Task Property.

For example a List "Today" can be the Collection of Tasks that have their time Property being equivalent to today's date, another List "Soon" can be the Collection of Tasks that have their Constraints ending soon etc, these Lists should be flexibly created by the user and also powerful enough to generate themselves.
