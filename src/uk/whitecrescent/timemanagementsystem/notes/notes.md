There could be "Free-Time decider". This means that when a Time slot is not filled with a Task then the app can choose randomly (or based on preference of level of importance) which Task to fill that slot with from a user-defined list of Recurring Tasks which would be a List of Preset Tasks. These Tasks should preferably be part of a Goal/ Habit. Note a Habit is different from a Routine.

A Routine is a set of Tasks that form a larger Task, it is a special type of Nested Task collection

Time Blocks do not have to follow natural time units, there can exist pre-defined units of time like a 45 minute block or some given blocks like a Pomodoro being 25 minutes. This will allow time planning based around any unit of time, including natural units like minutes or hours, or user-defined units. Note that time can be more than days or months.

Time blocks can be a range and not and exact number, for example a Time Block Range called "Short" can be user-defined to be between 10-30 minutes. This can then be set as a time based property of the Task. A Time Block can be defined using a natural time unit or even other Time Units, for example a "Full Pomodoro" could include 4 Units of "Pomodoro", which itself is defined using natural units.

For any time we can use the new Java Time API in `java.time.*`

We should have a timer in the app

Tasks can exist in pairs or groups, this would be a Routine or not necessarily

### Todoist features:
* Projects, like larger scale categories, similar to Lists or Boards in Trello, in a Project you have similar and related Tasks and they can all be viewed by date in the Main / Inbox Project
* Labels are like custom categories or tags
* Priority levels
* Parent Tasks
* Comments
* Reminders
* Tasks can be delegated to a later time, so instead of being failed they can age
* All kinds of sorting, filtering and data analytics
* Search feature

Templates so this is like a Skeleton.
