# TODO

* Organize tests properly

* Documentation (A good way of better understanding the codebase and allowing for easy returning)

* Before and after should be done by using something other than Tasks, like Task ID

* Make sure all Task Properties are working perfectly

* Make sure before and after Constraints work well with Tuples perfectly

* Make sure Properties can become Constraints and still work

* Make sure killing and failing and the Task Lifecycle works perfectly
