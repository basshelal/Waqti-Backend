/**
 * Used to indicate that is either not recommended or not necessary (or both) to override the function, property,
 * constructor or class (even though it is allowed). This would usually be because the current implementation should
 * be sufficient for most applications and therefore an override (without calling super) cannot guarantee a desired
 * outcome.
 *
 * The details of why it is not recommended to override and what actions to take when needed to override should be
 * documented clearly.
