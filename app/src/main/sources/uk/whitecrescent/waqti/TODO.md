# TODO (Short)

* Move everything to Android!

* Fix up Template Tasks and Bundles, when done implement it in the Cache

* Fix the Timer
# TODO (Long)

* Write Markdown Documentation for Tuple

* Write Markdown Documentation for Habit subsystem (Routine, Habit, Goal)

* Write Markdown Documentation for Lists

* Write Markdown Documentation for Habit subsystem (Routine, Habit, Goal)

* Write stories tests to test as many possible scenarios, here we try to write tests to break the thing

* Finish documentation inside Task class

* Update Task Markdown Documentation when Task is finalized

# Notes

* Boards will contain Lists, there will be merger Boards which will contain the contents of one or more other Boards

* Collections like Tuples, Lists, TimedLists, Boards and maybe others, TodayList, PriorityList Lists that allow only 
specific Tasks etc

* Lists will contain Tasks (and Tuples), there will be Lists with types such as TimedLists like a List for Today etc,
 there will also be Lists that allow only certain Tasks 

* Tuples are an ordering of Tasks using each Task's before Property

* Routine is a pre-defined Tuple or Task that occurs every so often and can become a Habit

* Habit is like a checkable list for each iteration of the Task/Tuple, Habits require a Routine to be killed which is
 what signifies the habit has been done
 
* Goal is a number of successes to have for a Habit, for example study French 30 times over the course of a month

* Priority collisions are not done on the Task level, they are done on the List level, specifically TimedLists which 
will check all their elements and see for collisions

* Calendar

* Recurring Tasks is a Collection of Anonymous Tasks

* Anonymous Tasks are non real Tasks that constrain that the real Task must have the same non-default Properties as 
the anonymous Task's Properties (like a placeholder)

* Macros are basically a skeleton/ framework to build up a list from, a collection of Tasks (Template or non)

* Moments are like reminders or notifications not Tasks

* Sorting, Searching and Analytics

* Free time decider using Recurring Tasks

# Done

* ~~Migrate all Time to use Jake Wharton's Time (or at least be easy to migrate it in the codebase)~~

* ~~AbstractWaqtiList Documentation and more Java usable using the right annotations like @JvmStatic and @Throws~~

* ~~Fix Task Duration with Timer setting~~

* ~~Make Bundle a "first class citizen"~~

* ~~Finish Timer, we will use this to have duration work better~~

* ~~Relative Time like tomorrow, next week etc~~

* ~~Figure out a better way to implement Template Tasks, maybe have a function in Task to get this Task's information 
and save it as a Template Task, using a state just for Template Tasks is a bad idea~~

* ~~Ensure the Task lifecycle works with tests and documentation~~

* ~~Finish all Properties with tests and documentation to ensure (as much as possible) they work perfectly as 
intended~~

* ~~Consider the Optional issue, should we make it constrainable and give it so much power over Task or keep it simple 
and keep it the way it is?~~

* ~~Fix the re-setting problem with the Un-constraining problem on all the Observers and test them and re-document~~

* ~~Consider the un-constraining problem (I suspect the solution may be simple but better to be safe), the problem: 
Think about when we un-constrain while it's checking the condition, for example if we have duration as a Constraint
 for a while then before it is met we un-constrain, the checking should end, but I don't think it will, we need to 
 test this extensively~~

* ~~Test Activity within Tasks, inside a Task, sub-tasks can interact with one another and with the parent, this is 
tricky but quite useful~~

* ~~Concurrent Constraint checking to transition between states in the lifecycle,
 meaning for example if deadline is a Constraint then there must be something that constantly checks the time to 
 compare the current time with the deadline time and when they are equal to act accordingly, in this case to fail 
 the task.~~

* ~~Deadline has the problem that if you kill before the deadline then deadline is an unmet Constraint and you can't 
kill at all! Maybe we disregard deadline from being one of the Constraints to be met before killing. Deadline must be
constrainable so that it can be a descriptor (show deadline but don't do anything special about it) and an enforcer 
(show deadline and make sure that the Task behaves accordingly)~~

* ~~Make Optional only a Property, having it as a Constraint is a little weird since why would one single Constraint 
cancel the effects of all the others? Let Optional be a descriptor only and not an Enforcer~~

* ~~Stop using JSON!~~

* ~~Based on Concurrent stuff, check which state we make the default,
WAITING should be the default since a Task is waiting to be relevant, however this can be an option?
Maybe we make Task be EXISTING and then if Time is set then it can change to WAITING, then when that time passes it
will be EXISTING, so the default state does not matter as much as having effective concurrent checking of Task's 
state (as in condition) in time.~~

* ~~When Task is given a Constraint we must change it to being failable automatically (this may also require Rx)~~

* ~~Remember Custom Time Units~~

* ~~Sun-4-Mar Rewrite the Documentation MarkDown files to make sure we can clearly define what we need especially for 
Task since there are ambiguities with Task Properties and Constraints and how a Task should behave~~

* ~~We need to define which Properties can be Constraints and which can't and the behaviours when Properties are 
allowed to be Constraints, why should Description be a Constraint??~~

* ~~Task Failing Sub-cycle (Failing, Sleeping and back to Existing (Waiting)) needs concurrent time checking, maybe 
we use Rx for this~~

* ~~Organize tests properly~~

* ~~Task Before and After Properties using TaskID and not Tasks~~

* ~~Store persistent Task IDs that are randomly generated somewhere, these identify Tasks,
 the idea being that every time a new Task is created (in the sense like created in the Database not really as in Objects)
  it is assigned a new Task ID randomly which is unique to it. This obviously requires persistence in mind.~~

* ~~Simple Task Persistence (Use JSON but consider SQLite since we can have the DB to use Task ID as Primary Key)~~
