There could be "Free-Time decider". This means that when a Time slot is not filled with a Task then the app can choose randomly
 (or based on preference of level of importance) which Task to fill that slot with from a user-defined list of Recurring Tasks 
 which would be a List of Preset Tasks. These Tasks should preferably be part of a Goal/ Habit. Note a Habit is different from a Routine.
 {Recurring Tasks}

A Routine is a set of Tasks that form a larger Task, it is a special type of Nested Task collection {Template Tuple}

Time Blocks do not have to follow natural time units, there can exist pre-defined units of time like a 45 minute block or 
some given blocks like a Pomodoro being 25 minutes. This will allow time planning based around any unit of time, including natural units
 like minutes or hours, or user-defined units. Note that time can be more than days or months. {TimeUnits}

We should have a timer in the app {Timer}

We can have sub-labels, labels that are part of labels

Tasks can exist in pairs or groups, this would be a Routine or not necessarily {Tuples}

Habit tracking

Routines and Habits go hand in hand, to build a Habit you need to create a Routine but not the other way round {Habits}

Task Collections!!

Lists are a Collection of Tasks and can exist with restrictions on the Tasks they can contain

Lists can have types, a List can be a Date or just a general List

Calendar View

Define the Grace Period (for the Duration Property).

Templates so this is like a Skeleton.

Recurring Tasks, this is different from Template / Blueprint Tasks

Projects / Boards could be like Boards in Kanban, there could be a feature to have the Master Board, the one that contains all Boards 
information and deadlines etc, or merger boards, an example of this would be a Board for a certain project and another board for another project 
and the merger Board would show deadlines for both Boards in order to have a big picture of the coming workload on the user. The Master Board 
would be exactly the same but would have all Boards info, this is like the Inbox of the Boards.

There will exist Routines, a set of Tasks together to form a specific larger Task

There will exist Habits / Goals, these are different from both Macros and Routines

There will also be macros, a set of Tasks that form like a skeleton/ framework for the day

Moments are significant points in time, things like "Sunset" or other things that just happen, not requiring the user to take any 
action, so not a Task, but an important point in time

We can bound slots to anonymous Tasks of certain Properties, an example of this is basically at 16:00 a Task with either
 the label of "Software Development" or "University" must be done, nothing else, so we can bound this time slot to an anonymous Task 
 that fits this criteria or accept a true Task that fits such criteria. We need to explain what bounded and unbounded time or slots means.

A Routine can be a template Tuple?

### Todoist features:
* Projects, like larger scale categories, similar to Lists or Boards in Trello, in a Project you have similar and related Tasks
 and they can all be viewed by date in the Main / Inbox Project
* Labels are like custom categories or tags
* Priority levels
* Parent Tasks
* Comments
* Reminders
* Tasks can be delegated to a later time, so instead of being failed they can age
* All kinds of sorting, filtering and data analytics
* Search feature
