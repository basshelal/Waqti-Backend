# Time

Time can exist in 2 different categories of Time Measurement Units.

* Natural Time Units: These are the natural existing units of time such as seconds, days, years etc

* Custom Time Units: These are units of time measurement that can be used to define a period of time, 
these will at the base level be defined in terms of Natural Time Units. For example we can create a new Custom Time Unit called 
"Duo" which represents a 2 hour period. We can also create a new Custom Time Unit called "BiDuo" for example which would represent 
a single Duo followed by a 30 minute period followed by another Duo. This shows how we can represent time using both units and create
new Custom Time Units based off of other Units of different category and type. Each unit is, at the base level, 
defined in terms of Natural Time Units.
