# Routine

A Routine is a special type of Tuple that is like what Template Tasks are to Tasks. Essentially a Routine is a pre 
defined Tuple (this can contain 1 Task) that is to be done every so often, meaning at an interval always for example 
something like Shave which can be done every 4 days or Drink Water which can be done every 2 hours. The reason for 
using a Tuple and not just 1 Task is because many commonly executed Tasks occur sequentially such as Have Breakfast, 
Shower, Brush Teeth, Wash Face, this is a part of a possible Morning Routine.
